"""Module B (authentication and team identity) contract.

Callers: Module A's token check (app/core/principal.py), Module K's team management,
Module C's API-key routes, and Modules E/F's team-existence checks. Module B owns the
`team`, `team_membership` and `user_identity` tables; nobody else reads them.
