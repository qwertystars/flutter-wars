# Deployment (Module M)

> The Worker preloads application imports at deployment for Cloudflare's Python
> memory snapshot. Binding-dependent app construction runs once per isolate on its
> first request; Hyperdrive connection properties cannot be read in global scope.
> Its settings and
> secrets are listed in [environment-reference.md](environment-reference.md#application-settings-module-a);
> set `JWT_SECRET_KEY` and `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` with `wrangler secret put` before
> the first deploy, and register `<worker-url>/auth/google/callback` as an authorized
> redirect URI on the Google OAuth web client.

Backend: Cloudflare Python Worker → FastAPI → sync SQLModel/SQLAlchemy → pg8000
→ Hyperdrive → Neon PostgreSQL. Migrations run outside the Worker, directly
against Neon (control-plane operation), never through Hyperdrive.

`app.factory` can be imported without reading settings or configuring the database;
`app.main` remains the conventional ASGI entrypoint. Keep heavy application imports
at Worker module scope so fresh isolates reuse the deployment snapshot. The Worker
also collects unreachable import-time objects before snapshotting, avoiding deferred
file-resource finalizers against the restored runtime's filesystem. Do not suppress
`ZipFile` exceptions globally. OpenAPI is generated and cached when the app is built.

## Worker bundle / plan capacity

The historical spike bundle was **~34.24 MiB uncompressed / ~7.66 MiB gzip**
and required Workers Paid under the recorded limits. It included psycopg binary
dependencies; the current Worker uses pg8000 because psycopg cannot load in
Pyodide (no libpq), verified on Cloudflare. Re-measure the current bundle with
`cd cloudflare && ./build.sh && uv run pywrangler deploy --dry-run` before
assessing plan capacity. Local dev, tests, and migrations still use psycopg.

## Hyperdrive caching decision: cache-disabled (primary binding)

Hyperdrive caches eligible read queries by default (`max_age` default 60s) and does
**not** invalidate cached results on writes. This platform has correctness-critical
reads — credits/wallet, inventory, market state, the read immediately following a
purchase/auction/transaction commit, IDE synchronization, and permission/auth reads
once those modules exist — where stale results are unacceptable. Therefore the
**primary `HYPERDRIVE` binding must target a cache-disabled Hyperdrive
configuration** (created with `--caching-disabled`, see step 2 below).

A future optimization MAY split this into `HYPERDRIVE_CACHED` (only for safe
catalog/public reads) and `HYPERDRIVE_FRESH`; correctness-sensitive reads must use
the fresh path. Verify the cache-disabled setting in the Cloudflare account; the binding id in
source alone does not establish cache behavior.

## Environments

| Environment | Worker | DB target | APP_ENV | Binding |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| development | uvicorn (`app.main:app`) or local `pywrangler dev` | `DATABASE_URL` or local Hyperdrive connection string | `development` for local tooling | local mode for Worker dev |
| production | `flutter-wars-api` | Hyperdrive → Neon production branch | `production` in Worker vars | `HYPERDRIVE` |

There is one Worker and one binding in `cloudflare/wrangler.jsonc`, with no
Wrangler staging/production environment blocks. Staging is a future option;
it would need a separate Worker, Neon branch, Hyperdrive configuration, and CI wiring.
Local development uses a development database rather than the production binding.

## One-time setup (needs Cloudflare + Neon accounts)

1. Create/select the production Neon branch/project.
2. Create a **cache-disabled** Hyperdrive configuration (use placeholders here;
   supply real credentials securely outside source):
   ```
   npx wrangler hyperdrive create flutter-wars-production \
     --connection-string="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST/DB?sslmode=require" \
     --caching-disabled
   ```
3. Set the returned id in `cloudflare/wrangler.jsonc` under `hyperdrive[].id`.
   An account-specific id is already configured; verify it matches the intended
   cache-disabled configuration. Hyperdrive ids are identifiers, not secrets.

## Credentials / secrets

Nothing sensitive is committed. Configure these outside the repo:

| Name | Where | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` | GitHub Actions secret | Deploy Worker |
| `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` | GitHub Actions secret | Deploy Worker |
| `PRODUCTION_DATABASE_URL` | GitHub Actions secret (env `production`) | Run migrations (Neon direct endpoint) |
| `PRODUCTION_BASE_URL` | GitHub Actions variable | Smoke-test URL |
| `DEPLOY_ENABLED` | Repository variable | Set to `true` to enable deployment |

No Worker runtime secrets are needed (the Hyperdrive binding carries DB creds). If
one is ever added: `wrangler secret put <KEY>` from `cloudflare/`. Locally use `cloudflare/.dev.vars`.

The deploy job uses the GitHub Environment `production`; add **required
reviewers** there for manual approval.

## Deployment order

Prescribed flow (see repository-root `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and
`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`):

1. CI runs lint, tests on Postgres 17, migration upgrade/check/downgrade/upgrade,
   a Worker bundle dry run, and the secret scan.
2. After green CI on `main`, deploy runs only when repository variable
   `DEPLOY_ENABLED=true`. The workflow also offers a manual dispatch under the
   same variable gate.
3. Apply migrations using `PRODUCTION_DATABASE_URL` (`alembic upgrade head`).
4. Build and deploy the Worker from `cloudflare/`.
5. Verify health/readiness with `scripts/verify_deployment.sh`.

**Compatibility rule (critical).** Migrations run **before** Worker deployment,
so they must remain compatible with the currently deployed app. Use the
**expand pattern**:

- Expand first: add nullable columns / new tables / new indexes.
- Migrate/backfill and switch reads/writes across releases.
- Contract (drop/rename/constrain) only in a later release, after no running app
  version uses the old shape.

If migrations fail, stop before deploying. If Worker deployment fails after a
successful migration, the old Worker must still work with the expanded schema.

## Commands

Wrangler commands use the config in `cloudflare/`; run them from that directory.

```
# deploy (from server/), Cloudflare auth required
scripts/deploy.sh              # Worker only; run migrations first
# equivalent: cd cloudflare && ./build.sh && uv run pywrangler deploy

# migrations (control plane; targets Neon directly)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql+psycopg://USER:PASSWORD@HOST/DB?sslmode=require" scripts/migrate.sh

# verify a deployment
scripts/verify_deployment.sh https://flutter-wars-api.<subdomain>.workers.dev
```

## Zero-downtime policy (decided — closed)

- No hard contractual zero-downtime requirement.
- Planned application deployments should aim for no intentional user-visible downtime.
- Risky schema changes use **expand → migrate → contract**.
- Do not perform unsafe destructive migrations during normal deployment.
- Prefer **forward-fix** over a DB downgrade once deployed application/data depends
  on the new schema.
- During live competition rounds, **freeze** normal production deployments except
  emergency fixes.

## Rollback

- Application: redeploy the previous Worker version — `wrangler versions list`,
  then `wrangler rollback` (or `wrangler versions deploy <version-id>`).
- Migrations: see `docs/migrations.md` (prefer forward-fix once data/code depends
  on the change; only `downgrade` a reversible revision with no dependent deploy).

## Deployment verification

The pg8000 driver choice was verified on Cloudflare; the former claim that
psycopg runs in the Worker is incorrect. For each release, verify the intended
Worker version, `/health`, `/ready`, the Hyperdrive configuration, and migration
head. CI deployment requires the secrets/variables above and `DEPLOY_ENABLED=true`.
